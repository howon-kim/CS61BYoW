2D tile-based world exploration engine

Your task for the next 2 weeks is to design and implement a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. By “tile-based”, we mean the worlds you generate will consist of a 2D grid of tiles. By “world exploration engine” we mean that your software will build a world, which the user will be able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects in that world. Your world will have an overhead perspective. As an example of a much more sophisticated system than you will build, the NES game “Zelda II” is (sometimes) a tile based world exploration engine that happens to be a video game:

The system you build can either use graphical tiles (as shown above), or it can use text based tiles, like the game shown below. Note that the world below is NOT a valid BYOW project (it doesn’t have rooms or hallways), it’s just an interesting example of a text-based game:

We will provide a tile renderer, a small set of starter tiles, and the headers for a few required methods that must be implemented for your world engine and that will be used by the autograder. The project will have two major deadlines. By the first deadline, you should be able to generate random worlds that meet the criteria below. By the second deadline, a user should be able to explore and interact with the world.

The major goal of this project is to give you a chance to attempt to manage the enormous complexity that comes with building a large system. Be warned: The system you build probably isn’t going to be that fun for users! Two weeks is simply not enough time, particularly for novice programmers. However, we do hope you will find it to be a fulfilling project, and the worlds you generate might even be beautiful.
